# Simple Leduc Hold'Em Poker

2 players, 2x3 cards (J, J, Q, Q, K, K).
## 1 hand = 5 rounds:
 1. each player gets 1 private card
 2. betting round
 3. single public card is revealed
 4. betting round
 5. winner is determined and takes the pot:
  - player with the same private card as the public card wins
  - player with higher card wins (J < Q < K)
  - draw (bets are returned)

## Betting:
 - only one raise by pre-specified amount (2/4 respectively for 1st and 2nd betting round) per round
 - fold -> hand ends and the other player takes the pot
 - call -> hand continues, pot gets updated

## Pot:
 - hand starts with players giving 1 to pot
 - players can only raise if they have enough money left
 - players can call opponents raise even if they dont have engough money (in that case the difference gets returned to the other player)
